```

## Overview

* This pitch and shiny application was built for the "Developing Data Products" assignment.

<br /><br />

* The developed shiny app for this assignment is available in this presentation and at: https://bswift.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/

<br /><br />

* The source codes of ui.R and server.R and also the presentation are available on the GitHub repo: 
https://github.com/kiprotich01/Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch.git

## Parabola

**Formula**
<br />$y = \text{'Stretch or compress'} * (\text{'X intercept'} - x)^2 + \text{'Y intercept'}$

<br />
**Stretch or compress**

* Strech (> 1.0) or compress (< 1.0) parabola
* Value between 0.2 and 1.8

<br />
**X intercept**

* Vertex position on the x axis
* Value between -10 and 10

<br />
**Y intercept**

* Vertex position on the y axis
* Value between -10 and 10

## Shiny App: Parabola
**Sidebar panel**

* sliderInput for Stretch or compress (min=0.2, max=+1.8, step=0.2)

* sliderInput for X Intercept (min=-10, max=+10, step=0.5)

* sliderInput for Y Intercept (min=-10, max=+10, step=0.5)

<br /><br />
**Main panel (ggplot)**

* Title contains the customized parabola formula

* Customized parabola (blue)

* Marked vertex of customized parabola (red)

* Normal parabola and its vertex (light grey)
